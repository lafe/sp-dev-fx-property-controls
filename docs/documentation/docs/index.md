# Reusable property pane controls for the SharePoint Framework solutions ![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@pnp/spfx-property-controls.svg)

This repository provides developers with a set of reusable property pane controls that can be used in their SharePoint Framework (SPFx) solutions.

!!! attention
    The controls project has a minimal dependency on SharePoint Framework version `1.3.0`. Be aware that the controls might not work in solutions your building for on-premises. As for on-premises solutions version `1.1.0` will get used.

## Getting started

### Installation

To get started you have to install the following dependency to your project: `@pnp/spfx-property-controls`.

Enter the following command to install the dependency to your project:

```
npm install @pnp/spfx-property-controls --save --save-exact
```

### Configuration

!!! note
    Since `v1.7.0` the localized resource path will automatically be configured during the dependency installing.

Once the package is installed, you will have to configure the resource file of the property controls to be used in your project. You can do this by opening the `config/config.json` and adding the following line to the `localizedResources` property:

```json
"PropertyControlStrings": "node_modules/@pnp/spfx-property-controls/lib/loc/{locale}.js"
```

## Telemetry

All controls gather telemetry to verify the usage. Only the name of the control and related data gets captured. 

> More information about the service that we are using for this can be found here: [PnP Telemetry Proxy](https://github.com/pnp/telemetry-proxy-node).

Since version `1.17.0` it is possible to opt-out of the telemetry by adding the following code to your web part:

```typescript
import PnPTelemetry from "@pnp/telemetry-js";
...
const telemetry = PnPTelemetry.getInstance();
telemetry.optOut();
```
